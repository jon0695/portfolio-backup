 This is a portfolio project I created for my Python Bootcamp.

 The 'Sorta Half-baked Adventure Terminal' Engine
 It is an extensable text adventure engine built using Python 3.11.

 Features:
 Page descriptions, moving to connected pages, death, changing page attribute in response to the player, easily extensable to create a 'full' game(be it a bit dull).
 all powered by three simple loops and many Page objects.

 REQUIREMENTS:
 Python 3.11 or above
 (Might work above Python 3.6, But I haven't tested that)

 INSTALLATION :
 Download the folder
 From a terminal or commandline, run 'python main.py' and it should work

 Tested on Manjaro Linux using zsh.
